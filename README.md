# Parental Control

I have kids and they are at home using laptops and the internet. This is a small program that can be run on a laptop to monitor the websites visited. The objective is to able to have a chat with your kids and make sure they are safe out there.

There are two parts I'm working on. One is tap the exisiting wifi interface. The other part is to do a rfmon tap, that way everything over wifi can be scrutinized .
